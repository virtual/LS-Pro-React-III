# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* propTypes - defines the type of variable expected to be passed into a React function's properties
	* .map() - runs a function over an array to iterate on each element
	* setInterval and setTimeout - setInterval repeats a function, setTimeout will cancel setInterval when set to an variable


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* Run: `npm install -g create-react-app`
	* Create a boilerplate React app called cards. `create-react-app cards`
	* Navigate into /clock and run the command: `npm start`
	* Your `<App />` component will render a `<Body />` component.
	* Create a file called `Body.js`.
	* `<Body />` will be a container for the `<Card />` components you create.
	* Try to emulate Instagram's layout for their cards.  
  	* Try creating multiple components to handle each part of Instagram's cards.  For example: a component for the likes count, a component for a comments container, a component for each comment, an image component, a separte image component for the author, etc.
	* Don't worry about the functionality.  Just try to emulate the appearance.
